     <!-- So, I tried your code on jsbin.com, and I can see the value increase and decrease as I move the slider. Unfortunately, it is not working on my end of repl. Check to see if it works on your end. The code is correct; I made a few tweaks. As of now, it is good to go for the first question. You may want to try out glitch if you find that repl is not giving you the desired output. Be mindful of this when you are working with js--your code may be correct, but the error is within the platform. I really hope this helps. Let me know if you have any additional questions. -Dom -->
